  A wonderful serenity has taken possession of my entire soul, like these sweet

  drawing a single stroke at the present moment; and yet I feel that I never was
  a greater artist than now.

# Awesome Day

A wonderful serenity has taken possession of my entire soul, like these sweet mornings of spring which I enjoy with my whole heart. I am alone, and feel the charm of existence in this spot, which was created for the bliss of souls like mine. I am so happy, my dear friend, so absorbed in the exquisite sense of mere tranquil existence, that I neglect my talents. I should be incapable of drawing a single stroke at the present moment; and yet I feel that I never was a greater artist than now. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/7ae73b90-96f7-4be4-a6d1-fb21c73d5615.jpg)
